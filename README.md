# Meta Programming: Day 1 of Makers Academy's "Five Languages in Five Days"
We were set the [challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/level_up/meta_programming.md) of writing a program that will create methods
on the fly, but only if they follow the pattern of "has_octocat?".
Using :method_missing and :define_method, we create a program
that more or less writes itself.
